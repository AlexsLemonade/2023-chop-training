This list provides some links to resources on reproducibility topics, with an emphasis on using `git` and performing code review.

Please note, this is not an exhaustive list.
It includes multiple types of resources for varying levels of experience, so we would not necessarily recommend every resource here for everyone.
Resources are listed by topic and in alphabetical order, not in order of recommendation.
